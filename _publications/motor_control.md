## Abstract

Brushed DC motors are widely used in industrial applications where speed regulation requirements are
critical. Speed control of DC motor using incremental optical encoder feedback mechanism and Simulink model of
DC Motor is presented in this paper. Quadrature decoding of encoder pulses is done to measure motor speed at a
sampling instant and PID controller algorithm is applied to compute control variable in the form of PWM. Motor
driver, here the H-bridge circuit, responds to the PWM signal and produces voltage proportional to PWM duty cycle
that actuates DC motor resulting in motor speed proportional to PWM duty cycle. Experiments show that proper
tuning of PID parameters result in smooth tracking of the reference speed.
