* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cse.sc.edu/) at [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/),
 advised by Prof. Ioannis Rekleitis.
* My research interest lies at the intersection of robotics, computer vision and  machine learning. I am particularly 
interested in adressing the challenge of Visual SLAM in marine environments and integrating machine learning algorithms
with classical SLAM algorithms.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Tribhuvan University, [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).
