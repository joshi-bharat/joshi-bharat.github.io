* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cse.sc.edu/) at [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/),
 advised by Prof. Ioannis Rekleitis.
* My research interests lie in the general area of robotics, particularly in marine robotics, simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), visual odometry as well as applications of deep learning based computer vision algorithms in robotics.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Tribhuvan University, [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).
